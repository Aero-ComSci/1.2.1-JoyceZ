Questions:
What is your favorite childhood memory?
Do/did you have a cherished childhood toy? If so, what was it? If not, what was your favorite toy?
What was the one lesson you learned growing up that stuck with you?
Would you say you were an "expensive" kid or an "inexpensive" kid

Reasoning:
By asking such questions, people can see how much theyâ€™ve grown and realize how much time has actually gone by. People can be reminded of old yet good memories trying to answer my survey/interview questions.
